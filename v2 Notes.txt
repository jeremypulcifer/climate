note for v2:

Here's how to compare two curves for differences in Java:
Represent the curves:
Store each curve as a list or array of points. Each point can be represented as a simple class or record with x and y coordinates.
Java

    record Point(double x, double y) {}
    List<Point> curve1 = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Point> curve2 = new ArrayList<>();
Normalize (if necessary):
If the curves have different lengths or scales, normalize them before comparison.
For length normalization, resample the curves to have the same number of points.
For scale normalization, you might scale the x and y coordinates of the points to a common range.
Calculate the difference:
Iterate through the points of both curves simultaneously.
For each pair of corresponding points, calculate the distance between them. The Euclidean distance is commonly used:
Java

    double distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(p1.x() - p2.x(), 2) + Math.pow(p1.y() - p2.y(), 2));
Aggregate the differences:
Sum the distances between all corresponding points.
Alternatively, calculate the mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to get an average difference measure.
Java

    double totalDistance = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < curve1.size(); i++) {
        totalDistance += Math.sqrt(Math.pow(curve1.get(i).x() - curve2.get(i).x(), 2) + Math.pow(curve1.get(i).y() - curve2.get(i).y(), 2));
    }

    double mse = totalDistance / curve1.size();
    double rmse = Math.sqrt(mse);
Thresholding or statistical analysis:
Compare the aggregated difference (e.g., total distance, RMSE) to a threshold. If it exceeds the threshold, consider the curves significantly different.
For a more robust comparison, consider statistical methods like calculating the correlation coefficient or using hypothesis testing to determine if the curves are statistically different.
